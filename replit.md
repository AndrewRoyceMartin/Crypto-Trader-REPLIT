# Algorithmic Trading System

## Overview

This Python-based algorithmic trading system is designed for cryptocurrency markets, offering backtesting, paper trading, and live trading capabilities. Its purpose is to automate trading strategies, manage risk, and provide a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and control. The system integrates a Bollinger Bands mean reversion strategy and comprehensive risk management controls. It includes a robust cryptocurrency portfolio system with realistic price simulation and tax compliance features for Australian reporting (ATO).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Trading Framework
A modular architecture supports CLI operations via `main.py` and a web interface via Flask (`web_interface.py`). It includes `BacktestEngine`, `PaperTrader`, and `LiveTrader` classes for different trading modes.

### Deployment Configuration (Updated: 2025-08-14)
- **Primary Entry Point**: `app.py` - Fast-boot Flask application with background initialization for ultra-fast deployment
- **WSGI Support**: `wsgi.py` - Enhanced production WSGI configuration with Flask environment settings  
- **Development Entry**: `main.py` - CLI-based entry with multiple modes
- **Port Configuration**: Uses PORT environment variable (defaults to 5000, maps to 80 for deployment)
- **Fast-Boot Architecture**: 
  - **Immediate Port Opening**: Flask server starts in <1 second with minimal initialization
  - **Background Warmup**: Trading system initializes in background thread with 8-second timeout
  - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Loading skeleton UI with automatic polling for readiness
  - **Persistent Cache**: OHLCV data cached to `warmup_cache.parquet` for instant subsequent boots
  - **Exponential Backoff**: API calls use retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability
- **Enhanced Health Endpoints**: 
  - `/` - Smart loading skeleton that polls `/ready` and auto-refreshes when system ready
  - `/health` - Instant health check responding immediately after Flask startup
  - `/ready` - Detailed readiness probe returning 200 only when warmup complete
  - `/api/warmup` - Real-time warmup status with elapsed time and loaded symbols
- **Hardened Configuration (Environment Variables)**:
  - `MAX_STARTUP_SYMBOLS=5` - Reduced symbol count for faster boot (was 10)
  - `STARTUP_OHLCV_LIMIT=150` - Reduced OHLCV bars per symbol (was 300)
  - `STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SEC=8` - Aggressive timeout to prevent deployment timeouts
  - `WARMUP_CHUNK_SIZE=2` - Smaller API request batches for rate limit compliance
- **Deployment Files**: `Procfile`, `deployment.json` with autoscaling configuration, and gunicorn settings
- **Production Server**: Gunicorn configuration optimized for Replit deployment with proper worker settings
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Configured for single port mapping (5000â†’80) to resolve deployment conflicts  
- **Version Tracking**: Version numbering system with `version.py` displaying current version (v2.1.0) in footer
- **Deployment Ready**: All tables functioning, no JavaScript errors, complete 103-asset portfolio system

### Strategy System
A plugin-based system using abstract base classes (`BaseStrategy`) allows for flexible strategy implementation, such as `BollingerBandsStrategy`. Strategies generate `Signal` objects with trade actions and risk parameters.

### Data Management
A two-tier caching system uses SQLite to store raw market data fetched via exchange adapters. `DataManager` and `DataCache` manage data flow, caching, and persistence to minimize API calls.

### Exchange Integration
An adapter pattern with `BaseExchange` provides a unified interface for various cryptocurrency exchanges, including `OKXAdapter` for demo trading and `KrakenAdapter` for live trading, handling authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization.

### Risk Management
The `RiskManager` enforces multiple safety layers, including portfolio-level limits, position sizing, daily loss limits, and emergency halts, performing checks before every trade.

### Web Interface
A Flask-based web interface provides real-time monitoring, portfolio visualization with Chart.js, and user interaction capabilities. It features a streamlined three-dashboard system (Main Portfolio, Performance Dashboard, Current Holdings), professional news ticker with breaking crypto market updates, and a professional footer. ATO tax export functionality is prominent. Rate limiting ensures compliance with CoinGecko API limits (6-second update intervals).

- **Code Quality**: Eliminated duplicate variable declarations and redundant DOM manipulation
- **Performance Optimization**: Streamlined table rendering with efficient innerHTML approach

### Technical Indicators
The `TechnicalIndicators` class provides vectorized calculations for indicators like Bollinger Bands and ATR, utilizing pandas for efficient time series data processing.

### Database Layer
The `DatabaseManager` uses SQLite for persistent storage of trades, portfolio history, and system state, ensuring proper connection handling and transaction management.

### Algorithmic Optimization
The system incorporates advanced algorithmic optimization for buy/sell decisions, including multi-timeframe momentum analysis, adaptive position sizing, enhanced risk-reward enforcement, progressive trailing stops, and market volatility regime detection.
