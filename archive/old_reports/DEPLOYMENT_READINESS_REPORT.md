### Deployment Instructions
1. Click "Deploy" button in Replit
2. System will use `python app.py` as entry point
3. Port 5000 will automatically map to deployment URL
4. Background warmup will complete within 8 seconds

### Next Steps After Deployment
1. Monitor deployment logs for any startup issues
2. Verify live price data connectivity
3. Test paper trading functionality
4. Confirm portfolio initialization with $10 values

## Recommendation: PROCEED WITH DEPLOYMENT
The system is stable, all core functionality is working, and deployment configuration is optimized for Replit's infrastructure.
