# OKX API Setup Guide

Your trading system is now configured to use only live OKX data (no simulation). To complete the setup, you need working OKX API credentials.

## Current Status
‚úÖ System completely removed all simulation data and fallbacks
‚úÖ Portfolio service configured for live OKX only
‚úÖ All endpoints updated to use real OKX data
‚úÖ Your API credentials are properly formatted and stored
‚ùå OKX API returning "API key doesn't exist" error (code 50119)

## Diagnosis Results
- ‚úÖ Credentials present: API key (36 chars), Secret (32 chars), Passphrase (8 chars)
- ‚úÖ OKX API is reachable from this environment
- ‚úÖ CCXT library working correctly
- ‚ùå OKX rejecting your API key with error 50119

## Error Meaning
Code 50119 "API key doesn't exist" means OKX doesn't recognize your API key. This happens when:

## Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. Wrong API Purpose (Most Common)
**Problem**: API key created for "Third-party app connection" instead of "API Trading"
**Solution**: 
- Log into your **main** OKX account (not demo)
- Go to Profile ‚Üí API Management
- Create a **new** API key
- **Important**: Select **"API Trading"** as the purpose (NOT "Third-party app connection")

### 2. Wrong Environment 
**Problem**: API key created for demo/testnet, but system connects to live trading
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're on the **live trading** environment when creating the key

### 2. Insufficient Permissions
**Problem**: API key lacks required trading permissions
**Solution**:
- Edit your API key settings
- Enable permissions: ‚úÖ Read ‚úÖ Trade ‚úÖ Funding

### 3. IP Restrictions (Critical for Replit) üîß
**Problem**: Your current IP is not whitelisted
**Current Replit IP**: `34.148.21.249`
**Solution**:
- **Recommended**: Leave IP whitelist EMPTY (allows all IPs)
- **Alternative**: Add current Replit IP: `34.148.21.249` 
- **Note**: Replit's IP can change, so empty whitelist is safer

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: If you get error 50110 instead of 50119, this confirms your API key works but IP is blocked!

### 4. Subaccount vs Main Account
**Problem**: API key created on subaccount but using wrong credentials
**Solution**:
- Ensure you're creating API keys on your **main account** (not subaccount)
- Check which account you're logged into when creating keys

### 5. Key Rotation/Expiry
**Problem**: Key was rotated, deleted, or expired
**Solution**:
- Delete old API key completely
- Create brand new API key with fresh passphrase
- Update all three credentials in Replit Secrets

### 6. API Key Status & Copying
**Problem**: Key disabled, expired, or incorrectly copied
**Solution**:
- Verify key is "Active" in OKX
- Double-check all three values were copied correctly
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters

## Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Go to OKX.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí API Management**
2. **Delete old API key** (if any)
3. **Create new API key:**
   - **API Key Name**: Any name (e.g., "Trading Bot", "Portfolio System")
   - **API Purpose**: Select **"API Trading"** (NOT "Third-party app connection")
   - **Environment**: **Live Trading** (not demo/testnet)
   - **Permissions**: 
     - ‚úÖ Read (required for balance/position data)
     - ‚úÖ Trade (required for order management)
     - ‚úÖ Funding (optional, for balance info)
   - **IP Whitelist**: Leave empty or use individual IPs (not 0.0.0.0/0)
   - **Passphrase**: Create a memorable passphrase
4. **Copy ALL THREE values exactly:**
   - API Key (36 chars)
   - Secret Key (32 chars) 
   - Passphrase (your custom phrase)
5. **Update in Replit Secrets:**
   - OKX_API_KEY
   - OKX_SECRET_KEY (or OKX_API_SECRET)
   - OKX_PASSPHRASE (or OKX_API_PASSPHRASE)

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 50119 After Following All Steps?

1. **Test with Clean Smoke Script First**:
   ```bash
   python smoke_test_live_okx.py
   ```
   This eliminates any app-specific issues.

2. **Common Hidden Issues**:
   - **Stale Headers**: Ensure no `x-simulated-trading` headers anywhere
   - **Wrong Account**: Verify you're on main account, not subaccount
   - **Credential Mismatch**: Passphrase must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
   - **IP Changes**: Replit's egress IP can change - use empty whitelist

3. **Verification Checklist**:
   - [ ] API key created for "API Trading" (not "Third-party app")
   - [ ] Environment: Live Trading (not demo/testnet)
   - [ ] Permissions: Read ‚úì Trade ‚úì 
   - [ ] IP Whitelist: Empty or contains `35.229.97.108`
   - [ ] Account: Main account (not subaccount)
   - [ ] Status: Active
   - [ ] All credentials copied exactly with no extra characters

## Current Replit IP
Your current egress IP for whitelist: `35.229.97.108`

## Final Test
Once API keys work with the smoke script, the main app will work identically since we've eliminated all sandbox fallbacks.

## Australia-Specific Requirements (IMPORTANT)

### For Australian Residents
Since March 2024, Australian users must complete additional verification:

1. **ASIC Compliance**: Complete Australian-specific identity verification
2. **Enhanced KYC**: Pass ASIC-compliant verification process  
3. **Service Limitations**: Only spot trading APIs available (derivatives restricted)
4. **Account Transition**: May need to transition to OKX Australian entities

**Check Your Australia Status:**
- Go to **OKX.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Verification**
- Look for "Australian Verification" or "ASIC Compliance" section
- Ensure this shows "Completed" status

If you see any "Pending" Australian verification, this will cause error 50119 even with correct API credentials.

### Additional Australia Steps
For some Australian users, after creating the API key you may need to:
1. **Accept Terms**: Complete Australian entity transition if prompted
2. **Wait for Review**: ASIC compliance review can take 15-30 minutes  
3. **Check Email**: OKX may send verification emails for Australian users
4. **Account Transition**: Some accounts need to transition to OKX Australia entities

If error 50119 persists with correct "API Trading" key, check your OKX account for any pending Australian-specific prompts or notifications.

### IP Whitelist Configuration
**Important:** OKX doesn't accept CIDR notation (0.0.0.0/0). Instead:

**For Replit deployment, add this specific IP:**
```
35.229.97.108
```

**Alternative options:**
- **Option 1**: Add the Replit IP above (most secure)
- **Option 2**: Leave IP whitelist completely empty (less secure but works)

**Note:** Your personal IP address is irrelevant because the trading system runs on Replit's servers.

The incorrect format 0.0.0.0/0 will cause API key creation to fail.

## Additional OKX Account Requirements

### Trading Authorization
Beyond the API key, your OKX account needs:

1. **Account Verification**: 
   - Complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
   - Identity verification must be approved

2. **Trading Permissions**:
   - Enable "Spot Trading" in your account settings
   - Enable "API Trading" authorization in account security settings

3. **Funding Requirements**:
   - Account must have sufficient balance for trading
   - Some features require minimum balance thresholds

4. **Security Settings**:
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled
   - Email verification enabled
   - Phone verification enabled

### Check Your Account Status
Go to: **OKX.com ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Verification** and ensure:
- ‚úÖ Identity Verification: Completed
- ‚úÖ Phone Verification: Completed  
- ‚úÖ Email Verification: Completed
- ‚úÖ Two-Factor Authentication: Enabled

Then go to: **Profile ‚Üí Security ‚Üí API Trading** and verify:
- ‚úÖ API Trading: Enabled
- ‚úÖ Spot Trading: Enabled

## System Changes Made

The system has been completely reconfigured to use only your real OKX portfolio data:

- ‚ùå Removed all SimulatedOKX fallbacks
- ‚ùå Removed all demo/test data generation
- ‚ùå Removed simulation portfolio initialization
- ‚úÖ System requires valid OKX credentials to start
- ‚úÖ Portfolio service uses live OKX balance/positions/trades
- ‚úÖ All status endpoints report live exchange connection
- ‚úÖ Price data comes directly from live OKX API

Once you provide working OKX API credentials, the system will display your real portfolio data immediately.
