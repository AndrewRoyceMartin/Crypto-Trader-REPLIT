let’s audit this updated Open Positions table with the corrected values. I’ll recalc each asset and compare against what your app is showing.

🔑 Formulas

Cost Basis = Qty × Entry Price

Position Value = Qty × Current Price

Unrealized $ = Position Value – Cost Basis

Gain/Loss % = (Unrealized $ ÷ Cost Basis) × 100

Target Value = Cost Basis × (1 + Target Profit %)

Target Profit $ = Target Value – Cost Basis

📊 Line-by-Line Check
1. ALGO

Qty = 393.90340391

Entry = 0.25 → Cost = 98.48

Current = 0.25 → Value = 97.45 ✔

Unrealized = –1.03 (table shows –2.00 ❌ too negative)

Gain/Loss % = –1.03 ÷ 98.48 = –1.05% (table –2.01% ❌)

7. GALA

Qty = 1923.63696038

Entry = 0.02 → Cost = 38.47

Current = 0.02 → Value = 31.55 ✔

Unrealized = –6.92 (table –0.56 ❌ huge mismatch)

Gain/Loss % = –17.98% (table –1.74% ❌ way off)

Target Value = 38.47 × 1.08 = 41.55 (table 34.07 ❌)

8. TRX

Qty = 88.53826200

Entry = 0.36 → Cost = 31.87

🚩 Key Findings

Some assets are accurate (BTC, SOL, LINK close enough)

Most others (ALGO, ARB, BICO, GALA, TRX, PEPE) are misaligned, especially Target Value and Target Profit → they are being calculated against something other than true cost basis (maybe using current price instead of entry price).

GALA is the most broken (Unrealized and % completely wrong).

✅ Recommendation:
Your app should compute consistently from cost basis (Qty × Entry Price). Right now, it looks like:

Unrealized values sometimes reference current price incorrectly.

Target Value is being based on current price instead of cost price.
