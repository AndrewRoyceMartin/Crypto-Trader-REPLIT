Here’s a tight checklist of what a solid Portfolio page should include for a crypto app, plus how it maps to the data you already expose (/api/crypto-portfolio, /api/status) and how to lay it out.

Must-haves (top section – KPIs)

Total Equity (converted to selected currency)

Cash Balance (free cash, stables, margin available)

Invested Value (sum of positions)

Unrealized P&L ($ and %)

Realized P&L (YTD/All-time)

24h Change ($ and %)

Win Rate (positions or trades, 30d)

Best/Worst Performer (symbol + %)

Max Drawdown (portfolio) (optional but nice)

Allocations & Exposure

Allocation donut: by asset (top 10 + “Others”), and toggle to:

By exchange/wallet (if multi-venue)

By category (L1/L2, DeFi, stablecoins, memecoins)

Exposure bars:

Long exposure % of equity

Stablecoin allocation %

Single-asset concentration (largest weight)

Optional leverage/margin used

Positions table (core)

Columns that matter:

Symbol / Name / Rank

Quantity

Avg Cost (incl. fees if you track)

Current Price

Current Value

Unrealized P&L ($ / %) (color coded)

24h P&L (optional)

Portfolio %

Targets (target sell / stop if strategy uses them)

Status / Signal (BUY/SELL/HOLD)

Last Updated

Actions: Buy / Sell / View

Nice touches:

Sticky header, column sorting, text filter, P&L filter (pos/neg), value bands, pagination

Inline tooltips for avg cost vs fee-adjusted cost

Lots & Realized P&L (optional tab)

Tax Lots table (FIFO/Specific ID): qty remaining, lot cost, current value, unrealized P&L

Realized P&L (YTD / MTD) with fees

Export buttons (CSV/ATO)

Orders & Trades (side panel or tab)

Open Orders: side, size, limit, status, time

Recent Fills (last 10): time, symbol, side, size, price, fee, realized P&L if closing

Performance mini-section

Mini equity line (24h/7d/30d) with hover

Benchmark toggle (vs BTC, ETH, or Total Crypto Mkt)

Rolling returns (7d/30d) and volatility (optional)

Risk & Limits

Daily Loss Cap progress bar (you already have this logic)

Largest position % (concentration risk)

VaR/Expected Shortfall (optional later)

Compliance flags (e.g., halted assets, stale prices)

Cash Flows (optional tab)

Deposits, withdrawals, transfers

Net flows vs P&L

Watchlist & Notes (lightweight)

Quick add to watchlist

Per-position note (last updated)

Suggested layout (wireframe)

Header KPIs (grid of cards)

Allocations/Exposure row (donut + bars)
