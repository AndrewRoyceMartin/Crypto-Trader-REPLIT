‚úÖ What's Expected to Populate the Page

The "Current Holdings" view is updated via:

updateHoldingsTable(cryptos)


Which is called inside:

updateCryptoPortfolio()


So when you call:

showCurrentPositions()


It runs:

window.tradingApp.updateCryptoPortfolio();


Which should lead to updateHoldingsTable(...).

üß† Likely Root Causes

Here are the top 4 reasons the Current Holdings page would remain empty:

1. ‚úÖ HTML ID Mismatch: positions-table-body Missing or Incorrect

Your function updateHoldingsTable() targets this element:

const tableBody = document.getElementById('positions-table-body');


If this ID is wrong or missing from your HTML, nothing will render.

Fix:
Ensure your HTML contains:

<tbody id="positions-table-body"></tbody>


If it's a different ID, update either the code or the HTML to match.

2. üö´ Portfolio Data is Empty

This log appears in your function:

if (!cryptos || cryptos.length === 0) {
  console.log('Portfolio is empty - user needs to start trading to populate data');


Check your console logs for this. If true, the updateHoldingsTable function exits early.

‚úÖ Verify:

You're running trades

API /api/crypto-portfolio is returning real data (see browser console, Network tab)

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è showCurrentPositions() is not wired correctly in the UI

Ensure your nav or button actually calls:

showCurrentPositions()


You can test this in console:

showCurrentPositions()


If that works and the table appears, then the issue is likely a missing onclick handler in your button or menu.

4. üîÑ Data Not Yet Ready When Called

If showCurrentPositions() runs before the data has finished loading, it may try to render an empty table.

‚úÖ Your code does call updateCryptoPortfolio(), which fetches data, so this shouldn‚Äôt happen unless the API call fails or times out.

You can confirm with:

console.log('updateCryptoPortfolio complete');

üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Debug Steps
‚úÖ 1. Check if positions-table-body exists

Run in the browser console:

document.getElementById('positions-table-body')


If null, fix your HTML.

‚úÖ 2. Check if cryptos are loaded

In DevTools console:

tradingApp.updateCryptoPortfolio()


Watch logs for:

Crypto portfolio API response

Portfolio is empty

or any fetch errors

‚úÖ 3. Manually test update function

Also in DevTools console:

tradingApp.updateHoldingsTable([
  { symbol: 'BTC', name: 'Bitcoin', quantity: 1.23, current_price: 50000, current_value: 61500, pnl: 1500, pnl_percent: 2.5, target_buy_price: 49000, target_sell_price: 60000 }
])


If this renders a row, the function works ‚Äî your problem is the data flow or HTML.
