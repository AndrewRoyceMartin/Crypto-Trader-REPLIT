why arent the crypto logos not loading?

Short answer: your CSP is blocking them.

You set:

resp.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
    "default-src 'self'; "
    ...
    "img-src 'self' data:; "
    "connect-src 'self'; "
    ...
)


That allows images only from your own origin or data: URIs. Most crypto logo sources are on external CDNs (e.g. CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, cryptoicons, OKX static), so the browser refuses to load them.

Fix (pick one)
1) Allow common logo CDNs (tight, production-friendly)
@app.after_request
def add_security_headers(resp):
    resp.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
        "default-src 'self'; "
        "script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com 'unsafe-inline'; "
        "style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com 'unsafe-inline'; "
        "font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; "
        "img-src 'self' data: https://assets.coingecko.com https://s2.coinmarketcap.com https://cryptoicons.org https://static.okx.com; "
        "connect-src 'self'; "
        "frame-ancestors 'none'; "
        "base-uri 'self'; "
        "form-action 'self'"
    )
    ...
    return resp

2) Dev-friendly (broad)

If you just want them working quickly:

"img-src 'self' data: https:; "


(Looser; consider locking down later.)

Also check these gotchas

Mixed content: Ensure logo URLs are https://, not http:// (http will be blocked on https pages).

Use Flask static paths: In templates, prefer

<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='icons/' ~ symbol|lower ~ '.svg') }}"
     onerror="this.src='{{ url_for('static', filename='icons/placeholder.svg') }}'">


This avoids path issues and provides a fallback.

Case sensitivity: If your files are btc.svg but your symbol is BTC, lowercase it (symbol|lower) or store both cases.

MIME type: With X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, SVGs must be served with image/svg+xml. Flask will do this; just make sure files are in /static/... and served via url_for('static', ...) (your custom /static/<path> route is fine).

CSP console: Open DevTools → Console/Network. You’ll likely see:

Refused to load the image … because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "img-src 'self' data:".
