let’s audit the Available Positions screenshot the same way as we did for Open Positions.

🔑 Core Formula (for “Diff %” and Target)

Target Price is usually derived from an assumed % target (here it looks like 8–15% lower than market, depending on asset).

Diff % = (Current Price – Target Price) / Target Price × 100

But in your table, “Diff %” looks like it’s being shown as the % difference between current price and target, inverted from how traders normally calculate entry targets. Let’s check line by line.

📊 Spot Checks
1. BTC

Current = 111,192.10

Target = 103,865.71

Diff % = (111,192.10 – 103,865.71) ÷ 103,865.71 × 100 = +7.06%

Table shows +6.59% (slightly off, maybe due to rounding or earlier price snapshot). ✔ close.

2. GALA

Current = 0.02

Target = 0.01

Diff % = (0.02 – 0.01) ÷ 0.01 × 100 = +100%

Table shows +12.40% ❌ (incorrect by an order of magnitude).

3. PEPE

Current = 0.00001

Target = 0.000009

Diff % = (0.00001 – 0.000009) ÷ 0.000009 × 100 ≈ +11.1%

Table shows +14.28% ❌

4. SOL

Current = 203.01

Target = 184.83

Diff % = (203.01 – 184.83) ÷ 184.83 × 100 ≈ +9.82%

Table shows +8.96% ❌ slightly under

5. TRX

Current = 0.34

Target = 0.31

Diff % = (0.34 – 0.31) ÷ 0.31 × 100 ≈ +9.68%

Table shows +9.90% ✔

6. ALGO

Current = 0.25

Target = 0.23

Diff % = (0.25 – 0.23) ÷ 0.23 × 100 ≈ +8.70%

Table shows +7.44% ❌

7. ARB

Current = 0.50

Target = 0.46

Diff % = (0.50 – 0.46) ÷ 0.46 × 100 ≈ +8.70%

Table shows +9.26% ❌ off

8. AUD (Fiat balance)

Current = 0.65

Target = 0.65

Diff % = 0 → 0%

Table shows 0.00% ✔

9. LINK

Current = 23.75

Target = 22.14

Diff % = (23.75 – 22.14) ÷ 22.14 × 100 ≈ +7.27%

Table shows +6.76% ❌

10. USDT

Current = 1.00

Target = 1.00

Diff % = 0 → 0%

Table shows 0.00% ✔

🚩 Findings

BTC, TRX, AUD, USDT → Correct or very close.

SOL, LINK, ARB, ALGO, PEPE, GALA → Misaligned with proper % diff formula.

GALA is the most glaring (should be +100%, not +12.4%).

✅ Recommendation

Recompute Diff % strictly as:

diff_pct = (current_price - target_price) / target_price * 100


and ensure all numbers are pulled fresh from the API at the same timestamp to avoid mismatch.
