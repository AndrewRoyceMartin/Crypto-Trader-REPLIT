deeper breakdown of all relevant OKX API v5 fields, including "card" fields—by which I assume you're referring to UI-like summary cards (e.g., cost price, PnL, spot trading performance). Here's a comprehensive, structured mapping of OKX API data fields that correspond to such UI card components, along with what they represent and how to implement them in your app.

1. Unified Account – GET /api/v5/account/balance

totalEq — Total Equity in USD: The entire portfolio value across all currencies in the unified account. This maps to the "Estimated Total Value" card headline.

details[] (per currency):

ccy — currency code (e.g. "SOL").

cashBal — available balance in that currency (spot holdings).

availBal — balance available for trading or withdrawal.

eq — equity of that currency in base units, contributing to totalEq.

2. Market Data – GET /api/v5/market/ticker

Fields to populate pricing and performance cards:

instId — trading pair (e.g., "SOL–USDT").

last — latest price.

open24h, high24h, low24h — 24-hour price range.

vol24h, volCcy24h — trade volume in base and quote currencies.

bidPx, askPx — best bid and ask prices.

ts — timestamp of the data.

Use these to calculate:

24H Change % = (last - open24h) / open24h × 100.

Display current price and price movement in a “Spot Trading Performance” card.

3. Market Candlesticks – GET /api/v5/market/candles

Essential for charting portfolio value or asset price trends:

ts — candle start time.

o, h, l, c — OHLC prices.

vol, volCcy, volCcyQuote — volumes.

confirm — flag (0 = in-progress, 1 = closed).

Use the c (close) values to build asset-value charts, potentially multiplied by your holdings.

4. Trades / Fills – GET /api/v5/trade/fills-history

For performance metrics like cost price and realized/unrealized PnL:

instId — trading pair.

side — "buy" or "sell".

fillSz — size filled (currency units).

fillPx — price per unit.

fee, feeCcy — trading fee and its denomination.

Use these to calculate:

Cost Basis: Weighted average buy price.

Unrealized PnL: (current price – cost price) × holdings.

5. Positions Data (WebSocket or REST)

For derivative positions (not typical spot cards but may still inform “Performance” cards):

instId, posSide, pos — instrument and position details.

avgPx — entry price.

last — current price.

upl — unrealized profit/loss.

uplRatio — profit/loss in ratio.

lever, mgnMode, posId — margin and position identifiers.

6. Wallet / On-Chain – Web3 & DEX APIs
On-Chain Wallet Total Value:

GET /api/v5/wallet/asset/total-value → totalValue in USD. Populates a “Total Value (on-chain)” card.
