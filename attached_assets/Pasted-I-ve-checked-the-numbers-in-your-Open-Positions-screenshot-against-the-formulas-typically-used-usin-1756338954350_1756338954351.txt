I’ve checked the numbers in your Open Positions screenshot against the formulas typically used (using OKX ticker + fills logic). Let’s go row by row and validate the math:

📊 Core formulas

Position Value = Qty Held × Current Price

Unrealized $ = Position Value – (Qty Held × Entry Price)

Gain/Loss % = (Unrealized $ ÷ (Qty Held × Entry Price)) × 100

Target Value = (Qty Held × Entry Price) × (1 + Target Profit %)

Target Profit $ = Target Value – (Qty Held × Entry Price)

✅ Spot Checks
1. ALGO

Qty = 393.90340391

Entry = 0.25 → Cost = 98.48

Current = 0.25 → Position Value ≈ 97.25 (shown ✔)

Unrealized = 97.25 – 98.48 = –1.23 (table shows –2.20 ❌ off)

Gain/Loss % = –1.23 ÷ 98.48 = –1.25% (table shows –2.21% ❌)

2. ARB

Qty = 190.4669795

Entry = 0.52 → Cost = 99.04

Current = 0.51 → Position Value ≈ 96.30 (shown ✔)

Unrealized = –2.74 (table says –3.15 ❌ off)

Gain/Loss % = –2.74 ÷ 99.04 = –2.77% (table shows –3.17% ❌)

3. LINK

Qty = 4.00437919

Entry = 24.97 → Cost = 100.04

Current = 23.75 → Value ≈ 95.09 (shown ✔)

Unrealized = –4.95 (table –4.92 ✔ close enough)

Gain/Loss % = –4.95 ÷ 100.04 ≈ –4.95% (shown –4.92% ✔ close)

4. BTC

Qty = 0.00042964

Entry = 113,264.46 → Cost ≈ 48.65

Current = 111,192.90 → Value ≈ 47.78 (shown ✔)

Unrealized = –0.87 (shown –0.88 ✔)

Gain/Loss % = –0.87 ÷ 48.65 = –1.79% (shown –1.81% ✔)

5. SOL

Qty = 0.17362898

Entry = 184.87 → Cost ≈ 32.09

Current = 203.01 → Value ≈ 35.24 (shown ✔)

Unrealized = +3.15 (shown ✔)

Gain/Loss % = 3.15 ÷ 32.09 ≈ +9.82% (shown +9.80% ✔)

🔎 Key Findings

Some rows are correct (BTC, SOL, LINK mostly).

Others (ALGO, ARB, BICO, TRX, etc.) are miscalculated, usually showing larger losses than the math supports.

Possible causes:

Entry price misalignment: maybe using average fills incorrectly (not true VWAP).

Rounding differences: but errors are too large for just rounding.

Fee-adjusted cost basis: If fees were included in entry cost, that could explain bigger losses.

Wrong current price source: If API price differs slightly from what’s displayed, that changes PnL.

🚩 Recommendation

You should recalculate Unrealized $ and Gain/Loss % directly from API data:

position_value = qty * current_price
cost_value = qty * entry_price   # or VWAP from fills
unrealized = position_value - cost_value
gain_loss_pct = unrealized / cost_value * 100


This will remove inconsistencies.
