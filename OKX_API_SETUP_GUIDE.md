# OKX API Setup Guide

Your trading system is now configured to use only live OKX data (no simulation). To complete the setup, you need working OKX API credentials.

## Current Status
✅ System completely removed all simulation data and fallbacks
✅ Portfolio service configured for live OKX only
✅ All endpoints updated to use real OKX data
❌ OKX API credentials need proper configuration

## Error Encountered
`"API key doesn't exist","code":"50119"`

This error means your OKX API credentials are not properly configured.

## How to Fix

1. **Go to your OKX account:**
   - Log into your main OKX account (not demo)
   - Navigate to Profile → API Management

2. **Create/Check API Key:**
   - Ensure you're creating the API key on the **LIVE** trading account (not testnet/demo)
   - Required permissions:
     - ✅ Read
     - ✅ Trade
     - ✅ Funding (optional, for balance info)

3. **IP Whitelist:**
   - Either allow all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) for development
   - Or whitelist the specific IP this Replit is running from

4. **Copy the exact values:**
   - API Key (36 characters)
   - Secret Key (32 characters) 
   - Passphrase (your custom passphrase)

5. **Update in Replit:**
   - Go to Secrets tab in Replit
   - Update: OKX_API_KEY, OKX_SECRET_KEY, OKX_PASSPHRASE

## System Changes Made

The system has been completely reconfigured to use only your real OKX portfolio data:

- ❌ Removed all SimulatedOKX fallbacks
- ❌ Removed all demo/test data generation
- ❌ Removed simulation portfolio initialization
- ✅ System requires valid OKX credentials to start
- ✅ Portfolio service uses live OKX balance/positions/trades
- ✅ All status endpoints report live exchange connection
- ✅ Price data comes directly from live OKX API

Once you provide working OKX API credentials, the system will display your real portfolio data immediately.
